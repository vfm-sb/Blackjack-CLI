# Blackjack Rules

## Blackjack Basics

1. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.
2. Each player is dealt two cards, face up. The dealer is also dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.
3. The value of a hand is the sum of the values of the individual cards. The value of a card is the number on the card (2 through 10), or 10 for a face card (Jack, Queen, King), or 1 or 11 for an Ace.
4. The player can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep their current hand.
5. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose immediately (this is called "busting").
6. After the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits or stands based on the value of their hand. The dealer must hit if their hand has a value less than 17, and must stand if their hand has a value of 17 or higher.
7. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins. Otherwise, the winner is determined by comparing the total value of the player's hand to the total value of the dealer's hand. The player wins if their hand is higher, the dealer wins if their hand is higher, and it is a tie if the hands have the same value.

### Premise of the Game

The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21.
Other players at the table are of no concern. Your hand competes only against the hand of the dealer.

The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated, leaving no decisions up to the dealer. Therefore, there is no problem with the dealer or any of the other players at the table seeing the cards in your hand.

### Values of the Cards

In blackjack, the cards are valued as follows:

-   **An Ace can count as either 1 or 11**.
-   The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
-   The **10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.**

**The suits of the cards do not have any meaning in the game. The value of a hand is simply the sum of the point counts of each card in the hand.**

Examples:
5 of Clubs, 7 of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds are equal to 21 (5 + 7 + 9).
Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Spades are equal to 20 (10 + 10).
9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, Queen of Hearts are equal to 22 (9 + 3 + 10), so this hand is a "bust".
> **Any hand that goes over 21 "breaks", or is "busted", and is an automatic loser.**

- An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. 
	- You need not specify which value the Ace has. 
	- It is assumed to have the value that makes the best hand, and that may change as more cards are added to the hand.
- A soft hand is any hand where an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 without going over 21. 
	- The name reflects the fact that the hand can't break if you draw another card. It's "soft".
- If we no longer have the option to count the Ace as 11, because that would go over 21. 
	- This hand would now be considered as a hard hard hand, despite having an Ace in it.

### Deal of the Cards

The dealer will deal the cards one by one. One for the player and one for the dealer. Then again one for the player and one for the dealer. Player and the Dealer will have two cards each. The dealer will flip one of his cards, exposing its value as the "dealer's upcard".

### Player Choices

The decision a player must make during the game is whether to draw another card to the hand ("hit"), or stop at the current total ("stand").

<br>

### How The Dealer (Computer) Plays His Hand

The dealer will first flip over the "hole card" to reveal his two-card starting hand. The dealer is then required to play his hand in a very specific way, with no choices allowed.

**He must draw cards until he has a total of 17 or more.** The dealer has no choice in how to play the hand. He must continue taking cards until his total is at least 17. (A slight variation of this rule is discussed below.)

### Wins, Losses, and Ties

**If you draw a card that makes your hand total go over 21, your hand is a bust. That is an automatic loser.**

Assuming you did not bust, the dealer will play out his hand at the end. **If he busts by going over 21, the player wins.**

If neither you nor the dealer busted, now the dealer will compare his final total to yours.

If his total is higher than yours, you lose the bet, and he will collect your bet and put the chips in his tray.

If your total is higher than his, you win the bet.

if you and the dealer have the same exact total, it is a tie. **A tie is called a "push", and you do not win or lose**.
