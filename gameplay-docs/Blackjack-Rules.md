# Blackjack Rules

## Blackjack Basics

1. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.
2. Each player is dealt two cards, face up. The dealer is also dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.
3. The value of a hand is the sum of the values of the individual cards. The value of a card is the number on the card (2 through 10), or 10 for a face card (Jack, Queen, King), or 1 or 11 for an Ace.
4. The player can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep their current hand.
5. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose immediately (this is called "busting").
6. After the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits or stands based on the value of their hand. The dealer must hit if their hand has a value less than 17, and must stand if their hand has a value of 17 or higher.
7. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins. Otherwise, the winner is determined by comparing the total value of the player's hand to the total value of the dealer's hand. The player wins if their hand is higher, the dealer wins if their hand is higher, and it is a tie if the hands have the same value.

### Premise of the Game

The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, without going over 21.
Other players at the table are of no concern. Your hand competes only against the hand of the dealer.

The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated, leaving no decisions up to the dealer. Therefore, there is no problem with the dealer or any of the other players at the table seeing the cards in your hand.

### Values of the Cards

In blackjack, the cards are valued as follows:

-   **An Ace can count as either 1 or 11**.
-   The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
-   The **10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.**

**The suits of the cards do not have any meaning in the game. The value of a hand is simply the sum of the point counts of each card in the hand.**

Examples:
5 of Clubs, 7 of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds are equal to 21 (5 + 7 + 9).
Jack of Diamonds, 10 of Spades are equal to 20 (10 + 10).
9 of Spades, 3 of Spades, Queen of Hearts are equal to 22 (9 + 3 + 10), so this hand is a "bust".
> **Any hand that goes over 21 "breaks", or is "busted", and is an automatic loser.**
